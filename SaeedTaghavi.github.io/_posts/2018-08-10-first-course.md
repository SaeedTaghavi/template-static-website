This is my first post in the courses category,
 I am just checking how to organize my posts
 in different categories, e.g. Posts, Projects, Courses, and Photos.
  
some thing is un clear to me, how can I use those different categories 
 to organize my posts, should I create different directories, or just 
  set tru in the heading of each post's md file!!!
